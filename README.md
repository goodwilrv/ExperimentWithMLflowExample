# ExperimentWithMLflowExample

This is an example of binary classification with the results logged in at MLFLow. I have also attached screenshots of the MLFlow after completing the result.

I have used 4 types of classifier on an imbalanced synthesized dataset. Here, I am using logistic regression, random forest, xgboost and xgboost with SMOTE to do the classification and then check the accuracy, precision, recall, F-Score of the classification.
